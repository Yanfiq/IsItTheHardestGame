# Nonsense Nebula's Problem Goes Pew Pew
A spaceship shooting game that is definitely not based on a game from 2002 called Platypus. This game was built using only C++ and the SFML library. This game was made without a game engine.

# How to play the game:
Just download the .zip file found in the release tab, extract the file, run the .exe file, and the game will run, probably...

# FAQ
### I get an error <insert error's name here>, what should I do?
  
  Clone this repository, open the .sln file in visual studio community, find the solution on stackoverflow, and fix the code. easy peasy lemon squeezy.

### Why is there so much RNG in this game. Won't this make the gameplay less consistent?

  "Why?", you ask. Of course because it's my game, I can do whatever I want. Cry your way out of here.

### Why don't you use one of the popular game engines like unreal engine, godot, or unity, but instead just use the SFML library?

  If you can do it the hard way, why do it the easy way?
  
### Can I use the code for "reference"?

  Sure.

  Warning: severe broken codes ahead.
