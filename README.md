# Nonsense Nebula's Problem Goes Pew Pew
A spaceship shooting game that is definitely not based on a game from 2002 called Platypus. This game was built using only C++ and the SFML library. This game was made without a game engine because if you can do it the hard way, why do it the easy way?.

# How to play the game:
Just download the .zip file found in the release tab, extract the file, run the .exe file, and the game will run, probably...
