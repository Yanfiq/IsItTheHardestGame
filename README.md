# Nonsense Nebula's Problem Goes Pew Pew
A spaceship shooting game that is definitely not based on a game from 2002 called Platypus. This game was built using only C++ and the SFML library. This game was made without a game engine, because if you can do it the hard way, why do it the easy way?

Warning: severe broken codes ahead.
